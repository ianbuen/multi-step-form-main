## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library 

### What I learned

My codes' pretty messy as I have been out of action from coding with React. I relearned how to make use of props and the Context API. As well as to make use of RegExp to handle simple validations.

### Continued development

I need to work on how to optimally use references. I need to study more of the implementation and use-cases of useRef vs forwardRef.
